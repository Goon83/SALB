             The Parallel Virtual File System, Version 2


    Parallel Architecture Research Laboratory, Clemson University

Mathematics and Computer Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory

PVFS2 is a next generation parallel file system for Linux clusters. It
harnesses commodity storage and network technology to provide concurrent
access to data that is distributed across a (possibly large) collection
of servers.  PVFS2 serves as both a testbed for parallel I/O research
and as a freely available production-level tool for the cluster community.

See the top level COPYING file for license information.

the terms of the GNU General Public License.
