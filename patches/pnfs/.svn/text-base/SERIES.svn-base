pNFS patches for PVFS provided by Dean Hildebrand.

* pvfs2 layout driver:

p00001_pnfs_pvfs2layoutdriver.patch
This patch was written against the pvfs2-1.5.1 release.  It creates a
pluggable module that the pNFS client can use
to perform I/O to pvfs2 I/O servers.

* pvfs2 server side (these patches build on each other):

p00001_pnfs_pvfs2layoutsupport.patch
In order to use the above layout driver, the nfs exported pvfs2 client must
be able to generate a data layout.  (via the pNFS LAYOUTGET rpc operation).
This patch generates a pvfs2 layout (via the nfsd export operations)

p00002_pnfs_nfslayoutsupport.patch
Currently there are 4 layout types: file, object, block,pvfs2.  This patch
provides support for the file-based layout.  Instead of
creating a pvfs2 layout (in the above patch), this patch creates a
file-based layout based on the existing set of I/O servers.
This patch makes the assumption that you have an NFS server running on each
pvfs2 I/O server.

p00003_pnfs_nfsproclayoutsupport.patch
This patch is a variant of the file-based layout patch above.  Instead of
creating a file layout that includes the pvfs2 I/O servers,
it uses a /proc variable to set the servers that should be used in the
layout.  This allows any node that runs a nfs server and exports a pvfs2
client to be included in the layout.  This is much more flexible than the
above patch, but requires the user
to manually set which servers the pNFS client will access for I/O.
