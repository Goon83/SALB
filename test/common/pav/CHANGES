pav2 
Big changes for pav and version 2
added to pvfs2 tree

pav-0.2c * AC change ------- Modified PAV so that the variable
COMP_NODEFILE will output the compute nodes in the login node.  I also
added check_all_nodes.pl which will check all these nodes and generate
node lists of good and bad nodes for ethernet and Myrinet.  I fiexed
the Myrinet option so that this version of pav will work with both
Jazz and Chiba for myrinet.

pav-0.2b * AC change ------- Modified the -myr suffix so that it works
with ccnXXX.mcs.anl.gov and ccnXXX.  Also added a test called
check_all_nodes.pl that can check a machinefile list with/without
Myrinet -Avery

pav-0.2 * Second release -------- crude understanding of myrinet: will
run pvfs over tcp-over-myrinet assuming hosts have the -myr suffix on
their tcp names (j335 becomes j335-myr)

pav-0.1 * First 'release' -------- added IONODE and COMPNODE keys to
pav_info output

cleaned up pav_lib.pl searching code, pav_lib.pl must currently be in
same dir as binaries

removed default behaviour of attempting to retry if some resoures are
bad
