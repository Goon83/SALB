<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN> Introduction</A>
</H1>

<P>
This document describes how to configure PVFS for high availability
using Heartbeat version 2.x from www.linux-ha.org.  

<P>
The combination of PVFS and Heartbeat can support an arbitrary number
of active server nodes and an arbitrary number of passive spare nodes.
Spare nodes are not required unless you wish to avoid performance
degradation upon failure.  As configured in this document, PVFS will
be able to tolerate <!-- MATH
 $\lceil ((N/2)-1) \rceil$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="109" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="$\lceil ((N/2)-1) \rceil$"></SPAN> node failures, where N is
the number of nodes present in the Heartbeat cluster including spares.
Over half of the nodes must be available in order to reach a quorum and
decide if another node has failed.

<P>
Heartbeat can be configured to monitor IP connectivity, storage hardware
connectivity, and responsiveness of the PVFS daemons.  Failure of any of
these components will trigger a node level failover event.  PVFS clients
will transparently continue operation following a failover.

<P>
No modifications of PVFS are required.  Example scripts referenced in
this document are available in the <TT>examples/heartbeat</TT> directory of
the PVFS source tree.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00031100000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN> Nodes</A>
</H3>

<P>
Any number of nodes may be configured, although you need at least three
total in order to tolerate a failure.  You may also use any number of
spare nodes.  A spare node is a node that does not run any services until
a failover occurs.  If you have one or more spares, then they will be
selected first to run resources in a failover situation.  If you have
no spares (or all spares are exhausted), then at least one node will
have to run two services simultaneously, which may degrade performance.

<P>
The examples in this document will use 4 active nodes and 1 spare node,
for a total of 5 nodes.  Heartbeat has been tested with up to 16 nodes
in configurations similar to the one outlined in this document.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00031200000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN> Storage</A>
</H3>

<P>
A shared storage device is required.  The storage must be configured
to allocate a separate block device to each PVFS daemon, and all nodes
(including spares) must be capable of accessing all block devices.

<P>
One way of achieving this is by using a SAN.  In the examples used in this
document, the SAN has been divided into 4 LUNs.  Each of the 5 nodes in
the cluster is capable of mounting all 4 LUNs.  The Heartbeat software
will insure that a given LUN is mounted in only one location at a time.

<P>
Each block device should be formatted with a local file system.
This document assumes the use of ext3.  Unique labels should be set on
each file system (for example, using the <TT>-L</TT> argument to
<TT>mke2fs</TT> or <TT>tune2fs</TT>).  This will allow the block devices
to be mounted by consistent labels regardless of how Linux assigned
device file names to the devices.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00031300000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN> Stonith</A>
</H3>

<P>
Heartbeat needs some mechanism to fence or stonith a failed node.
Two popular ways to do this are either to use IPMI or a network
controllable power strip.  Each node needs to have a mechanism available
to reset any other node in the cluster.  The example configuration in
this document uses IPMI.

<P>
It is possible to configure PVFS and Heartbeat without a power control
device.  However, if you deploy this configuration for any purpose other
than evaluation, then you run a very serious risk of data
corruption.   Without stonith, there is no way to guarantee that a
failed node has completely shutdown and stopped accessing its
storage device before failing over.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00032000000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN> Software</A>
</H2>

<P>
This document assumes that you are using Heartbeat version 2.1.3,
and PVFS version 2.7.x or greater.  You may also wish to use example
scripts included in the <TT>examples/heartbeat</TT> directory of the
PVFS source tree.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00033000000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN> Network</A>
</H2>

<P>
There are two special issues regarding the network configuration to be
used with Heartbeat.  First of all, you must allocate a multicast
address to use for communication within the cluster nodes.

<P>
Secondly, you need to allocate an extra IP address and hostname for each
PVFS daemon.  In the example that this document uses, we must allocate 4
extra IP addresses, along with 4 hostnames in DNS for those IP addresses.
In this document, we will refer to these as ``virtual addresses'' or
``virtual hostnames''.  Each active PVFS server will be configured
to automatically bring up one of these virtual addresses to use for
communication.  If the node fails, then that IP address is migrated to
another node so that clients will appear to communicate with the same
server regardless of where it fails over to.  It is important that you
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">not</SPAN> use the primary IP address of each node for this purpose.

<P>
In the example in this document, we use 225.0.0.1 as the multicast
address, node{1-5} as the normal node hostnames,
virtual{1-4} as the virtual hostnames, and 192.168.0.{1-4} as the
virtual addresses.

<P>
Note that the virtual addresses must be on the same subnet as the true
IP addresses for the nodes.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00040000000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN> Configuring PVFS</A>
</H1>

<P>
Download, build, and install PVFS on all server nodes.  Configure PVFS
for use on each of the active nodes.  

<P>
There are a few points to consider when configuring PVFS:

<UL>
<LI>Use the virtual hostnames when specifying meta servers and I/O
servers
</LI>
<LI>Synchronize file data on every operation (necessary for consistency on
failover)
</LI>
<LI>Synchronize meta data on every operation (necessary for consistency on
failover).  Coalescing is allowed.
</LI>
<LI>Use the <TT>TCPBindSpecific</TT> option (this allows multiple daemons to
run on the same node using different virtual addresses)
</LI>
<LI>Tune retry and timeout values appropriately for your system.  This
may depend on how long it takes for your power control device to safely
shutdown a node.
</LI>
</UL>

This section describes how to configure the basic Heartbeat daemon
parameters, which include an authentication key and a list of nodes that
will participate in the cluster.

<P>
Begin by generating a random sha1 key, which is used to
secure communication between the cluster nodes.  Then run the
pvfs2-ha-heartbeat-configure.sh script on every node (both active
and spare) as shown below.  Make sure to use the multicast address, sha1

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00090000000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">8</SPAN> CIB configuration</A>
</H1>

<P>
<TT>Cluster Information Base</TT> (CIB) is the the mechanism that
Heartbeat 2.x uses to store information about the resources that are 
configured for high availability.  The configuration is stored in an
XML format and automatically synchronized across all of the cluster
nodes.

<P>
It is possible to start the Heartbeat services and then configure the
CIB, but it is simpler to begin with a populated XML file on all nodes.

<P>
<TT>cib.xml.example</TT> provides an example of a fully populated
Heartbeat configuration with 5 nodes and 4 active PVFS servers.  Relevant
portions of the XML file are outlined below.

<P>
This file should be modified to reflect your configuration.  You can
test the validity of the XML with the following commands before
installing it.  The former checks generic XML syntax, while the latter
performs Heartbeat specific checking:

<P>
<PRE>
$ xmllint --noout cib.xml
$ crm_verify -x cib.xml
</PRE>

<P>
Once your XML is filled in correctly, it must be copied into the correct
location (with correct ownership) on each node in the cluster:

<P>
<PRE>
$ mkdir -p /var/lib/heartbeat/crm
$ cp cib.xml /var/lib/heartbeat/crm
$ chown -R hacluster:haclient /var/lib/heartbeat/crm
</PRE>

<P>
Please note that once Heartbeat has been started, it is no longer
legal to modify cib.xml by hand.  See the <TT>cibadmin</TT> command line
tool and Heartbeat information on making modifications to
existing or online CIB configurations.

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00091000000000000000">

<P>
The <TT>crm_config</TT> portion of the CIB is used to set global
parameters for Heartbeat.  This includes behavioral settings
(such as how to respond if quorum is lost) as well as tunable parameters
(such as timeout values).

<P>
The <TT>resources</TT> section describes all resources that the
Heartbeat software needs to manage for failover purposes.  This includes
IP addresses, SAN mount points, and <TT>pvfs2-server</TT> processes.  The
resources are organized into groups, such as <TT>server0</TT>, to
indicate that certain groups of resources should be treated as a single
unit.  For example, if a node were to fail, you cannot just migrate its
<TT>pvfs2-server</TT> process.  You must also migrate the associated IP address
and SAN mount point at the same time.  Groups also make it easier to
start or stop all associated resources for a node with one unified command.

<P>
In the example <TT>cib.xml</TT>, there are 4 groups (server0 through
server3).  These represent the 4 active PVFS servers that will run on
the cluster.

<P>
The <TT>IPaddr</TT> resources, such as <TT>server0_address</TT>, are
used to indicate what virtual IP address should be used with each group.
In this example, all IP addresses are allocated from a private range, but
these should be replaced with IP addresses that are appropriate for use
on your network.  See the network requirements section for more details.

The <TT>Filesystem</TT> resources, such as <TT>server0_fs</TT>, are used to
describe the shared storage block devices that serve as back end storage
for PVFS.  This is where the PVFS storage space for each server will
be created.  In this example, the device names are labeled as
<TT>label0</TT>
through <TT>label3</TT>.  They are each mounted on directories such
as <TT>/san_mount0</TT> through <TT>/san_mount3</TT>.  Please note
that each device should be mounted on a different mount point to allow
multiple <TT>pvfs2-server</TT> processes to operate on the same node without
collision.  The file system type can be changed to reflect the use of
alternative underlying file systems.

Also notice that there is a monitor operation associated with the PVFS
resource.  This will cause the <TT>pvfs2-check-server</TT> utility to be triggered
periodically to make sure that the <TT>pvfs2-server</TT> process is not only
running, but is correctly responding to PVFS protocol requests.  This
allows problems such as hung <TT>pvfs2-server</TT> processes to be treated as
failure conditions.

<P>
Please note that the PVFS2 script provided in the examples will attempt
to create a storage space on startup for each server if it is not already present.

</H2>

<P>
The <TT>rsc_location</TT> constraints, such as <TT>run_server0</TT>,
are used to express a preference for where each resource group should
run (if possible).  It may be useful for administrative purposes to have
the first server group default to run on the first node of your cluster,
for example.  Otherwise the placement will be left up to Heartbeat.

</H2>

<P>
The <TT>rsc_order</TT> constraints, such as
<TT>server0_order_start_fs</TT> can be used to dictate the order in
which resources must be started or stopped.  The resources are already
organized into groups, but without ordering constraints, the resources
within a group may be started in any order relative to each other.
These constraints are necessary because a <TT>pvfs2-server</TT> process will not
start properly until its IP address and storage are available.

</H2>

<P>
The <TT>external/ipmi</TT> stonith device is used in this example.
Please see the Heartbeat documentation for instructions on configuring
other types of devices.

<P>
There is one IPMI stonith device for each node.  The attributes for that
resources specify which node is being controlled, and the username,
password, and IP address of corresponding IPMI device.

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">9</SPAN> Starting Heartbeat</A>
</H1>

<P>
Once the CIB file is completed and installed in the correct
location, then the Heartbeat services can be started on every node.
The <TT>crm_mon</TT> command, when run with the arguments shown,
will provide a periodically updated view of the state of each resource
configured within Heartbeat.  Check <TT>/var/log/messages</TT> if any
of the groups fail to start.

$ /etc/init.d/heartbeat start

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">10</SPAN> Mounting the file system</A>
</H1>

<P>
Mounting PVFS with high availability is no different than mounting a
normal PVFS file system, except that you must use the virtual hostname
for the PVFS server rather than the primary hostname of the node:

<P>
<PRE>
$ mount -t pvfs2 tcp://virtual1:3334/pvfs2-fs /mnt/pvfs2

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">11</SPAN> What happens during failover</A>
</H1>

<P>
The following example illustrates the steps that occur when a node fails:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Node2 (which is running a <TT>pvfs2-server</TT> on the virtual2 IP
address) suffers a failure
</LI>
<LI>Client node begins timeout/retry cycle
</LI>
<LI>Heartbeat services running on remaining nodes notice that node2
is not responding
</LI>
<LI>After a timeout has elapsed, remaining nodes reach a quorum and
vote to treat node2 as a failed node
</LI>
<LI>Node1 sends a stonith command to reset node2
</LI>
<LI>Node2 either reboots or remains powered off (depending on nature
of failure)
</LI>
<LI>Once stonith command succeeds, node5 is selected to replace it
</LI>
<LI>The virtual2 IP address, mount point, and
<TT>pvfs2-server</TT> service
are started on node5
</LI>
<LI>Client node retry eventually succeeds, but now the network
traffic is routed to node5
</LI>
</OL>

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">12</SPAN> Controlling Heartbeat</A>
</H1>

<P>
The Heartbeat software comes with a wide variety of tools for managing
resources.  The following are a few useful examples:

<UL>
<LI><TT>cibadmin -Q</TT>: Display the current CIB information
</LI>
<LI><TT>crm_mon -r -1</TT>: Display the current resource status
</LI>
<LI><TT>crm_standby</TT>: Used to manually take a node in an out of
standby mode.  This can be used to take a node offline for maintenance
without a true failure event.
</LI>
<LI><TT>crm_resource</TT>: Modify resource information.  For example,
<TT>crm_resource -r server0 -p target_role -v stopped</TT> will stop a
particular resource group.
</LI>
<LI><TT>crm_verify</TT>: can be used to confirm if the CIB
information is valid and consistent

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">13</SPAN> Additional examples</A>
</H1>

<P>
The <TT>examples/heartbeat/hardware-specific</TT> directory contains
additional example scripts that may be helpful in some scenarios:

<P>

<UL>
<LI><TT>pvfs2-stonith-plugin</TT>: An example stonith plugin
that can use an arbitrary script to power off nodes.  May be used (for
example) with the <TT>apc*</TT> and <TT>baytech*</TT> scripts to control
remote controlled power strips if the scripts provided by Heartbeat are
not sufficient.
</LI>
<LI><TT>Filesystem-qla-monitor</TT>: A modified version of the
standard FileSystem resource that uses the <TT>qla-monitor.pl</TT>
script to provide additional monitoring capability for QLogic fibre
channel cards. 
</LI>
<LI><TT>PVFS2-notify</TT>: An example of a dummy resource that could
be added to the configuration to perform additional logging or
notification steps on startup.
