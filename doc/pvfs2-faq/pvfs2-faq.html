<H1><A NAME="SECTION00020000000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN> Basics</A>
</H1>

<P>
This section covers some basic questions for people who are unfamiliar with PVFS.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00021000000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN> What is PVFS?</A>
</H2>

<P>
PVFS is an open-source, scalable parallel file system targeted at production
parallel computation environments.  It is designed specifically to scale to
very large numbers of clients and servers.  The architecture is very modular,
allowing for easy inclusion of new hardware support and new algorithms.  This
makes PVFS a perfect research testbed as well.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00022000000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN> What does the ``V'' in PVFS stand for?</A>
</H2>

<P>
The ``V'' in PVFS stands for virtual.  This is a holdover from the original
(PVFS1) project that built a parallel file system on top of local file
systems, which we still do now.  It isn't meant to imply virtualization of
storage, although that is sort of what the file system does.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00023000000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN> Is PVFS an attempt to parallelize the *NIX VFS?</A>
</H2>

<P>
No, and we're not even sure what that means!  The design of PVFS does
not depend on the design of the traditional *NIX Virtual Filesystem
Switch (VFS) layer, although we provide a compatibility layer that
allows access to the file system through it.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00024000000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN> What are the components of PVFS that I should know about?</A>
</H2>

<P>
The PVFS Guide (<TT><A NAME="tex2html1"
  HREF="http://www.pvfs.org/pvfs2-guide.html">http://www.pvfs.org/pvfs2-guide.html</A></TT>) has more
information on all of these components, plus a discussion of the system as a
whole, the code tree, and more.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00025000000000000000"></A>
<A NAME="sec:version-string"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">5</SPAN> What is the format of the PVFS version string?
</H2>
PVFS uses a three-number version string: X.Y.Z.  The first number (X)
represents the high level design version of PVFS.  The current design
version is 2, and will likely remain there.  The second number (Y) refers
to the major version of the release.  Major versions are incremented with
new features, protocol changes, public API changes, and storage format
changes.  The third number (Z) refers to the minor version of the release,
and is incremented primarily for bug fix releases.

<P>
With our 2.6.0 release,
we changed the release version and name from PVFS2 1.x.x, to PVFS 2.x.x.
Users familiar with 'PVFS2' and had been using PVFS2 1.5.1 
will find the same software in PVFS version 2.6.0 or
later (with updates and new features of course).

<P>
Users of PVFS version 1 can still go to:
<TT><A NAME="tex2html2"
  HREF="http://www.parl.clemson.edu/pvfs">http://www.parl.clemson.edu/pvfs</A></TT>, although we highly
encourage you to upgrade to PVFS version 2, if you are still using
version 1.

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00030000000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN> Supported Architectures and Hardware</A>
</H1>

<P>
This section covers questions related to particular system architectures,
operating systems, and other hardware.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00031000000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN> Does PVFS require any particular hardware?</A>
</H2>

<P>
Other than hardware supported by the Linux OS, no.  PVFS uses
existing network infrastructure for communication and can currently
operate over TCP, Myrinet, and InfiniBand.  Disk local to servers is
used for PVFS storage, so no storage area network (SAN) is required
either (although it can be helpful when setting up fault tolerant solutions;
see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:fault-tolerance">7</A>.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00032000000000000000"></A>
<A NAME="sec:supported-architectures"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN> What architectures does PVFS support?
</H2>

<P>
The majority of PVFS is POSIX-compliant C code that runs in user
space.  As such, much of PVFS can run on most available systems.  See
Question&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:supported-hw">2.5</A> for more information on particular
hardware.

<P>
The (optional) part of PVFS that hooks to the operating system on
clients must be written specifically for the particular operating
system.  Question&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:kernel-version">2.4</A> covers this issue.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00033000000000000000">

Yes!  The ``language'' that PVFS uses to talk between clients and
servers is encoded in a architecture-independent format (little-endian
with fixed byte length parameters).  This allows different PVFS
components to interact seamlessly regardless of architecture.

</H2>

<P>
You can run the userspace PVFS servers and administration tools on
every major GNU/Linux distribution out of the box, and we intend to
keep it that way.
However, the kernel module that allows client access to the PVFS system
does depend on particular kernel versions because it builds against
the running one (in the same manner as every other Linux module).
The kernel dependent PVFS client support has been written for Linux
kernel versions 2.4.19 (and greater) and 2.6.0 (and greater).  At this
time only Linux clients have this level of support.

No.  The kernel module source included with PVFS is generally

<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN> How can I store PVFS data on multiple disks on a single node?
</H2>

<P>
There are at least two ways to do this.

<P>
In general the best solution to this problem is going to be to get the disks
logically organized into a single unit by some other OS component, then build
a file system on that single logical unit for use by the PVFS server on that
node.

<P>
There are a wide array of hardware RAID controllers that are capable of
performing this task.
The Multiple Devices (MD) driver is a software component of Linux that can be
used to combine multiple disk drives into a single logical unit, complete with
RAID for fault tolerance.
Using the Logical Volume Management (LVM) component of the Linux OS is another
option for this (see the HOWTO at
<TT><A NAME="tex2html4"
  HREF="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO.html">http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO.html</A></TT>).  LVM would also allow you to
add or remove drives at a later time, which can be quite convenient.  You
can of course combine the MD and LVM components in interesting ways as well,
but that's outside the scope of this FAQ.
There's an EVMS program that can be used for managing local storage; this
might be useful for setting up complicated configurations of local storage
prior to starting up PVFS servers.

<P>
A second solution would be to use more than one server on the same node, each
using a different file system to store its data.  This might lead to resource
contention issues, so we suggest trying other options first.

<P>
If you do decide to run more than one PVFS server on the same node,
setting things up is as simple as setting up servers on different
nodes.  Each will need its own entry in the list of Aliases and its
own server-specific configuration file, as described in the Quick Start

Absolutely!  Any PVFS server can store either metadata, data, or both.
Simply allocate unique MetaHandleRanges for each server that you would like to
store metadata; the clients will handle the rest.

these servers.  For information on better handling failures, see

<A NAME="sec:howmany-servers"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">6</SPAN> How many servers should I run?
</H2>

<P>
Really, the answer is ``it depends'', but here are some factors you
should take into account.  

<P>
Running multiple metadata servers might help if you expect to have have
a lot of small files.  The metadata servers are not involved in data
access (file contents) but do have a role in file creation and lookup.
Multiple clients accessing different files will likely access different
metadata servers, so you could see a load balancing effect.

<P>
A good rule of thumb is you should run as many data servers as possible.
One common configuration is to have some nodes with very
high-performance disks acting as servers to the larger cluster.  As you
use more servers in this configuration, the theoretical peak performance
of PVFS increases.  The clients, however, have to make very large
requests in order to stripe the I/O across all the servers.  If your
clients will never write large files, use a smaller number of servers.
If your clients are writing out gigantic checkpoint files or reading in
huge datasets, then use more servers.

<P>
It is entirely possible to run PVFS servers on the same nodes doing
computation. In most cases, however, you will see better performance
if you have some portion of your cluster dedicated to IO and another
portion dedicated to computation.

<P>
The Linux automounter needs some help dealing with PVFS's resource

<P>
<PRE>
	mount -t pvfs2 tcp://server0:3334/pvfs2-fs /mnt/pvfs2

</H2>

<P>
First, make 100% sure you typed the mount command correctly. As discussed in
the PVFS quickstart, different mount commands are needed for linux-2.4 and
linux-2.6.  A linux-2.6 mount command will look like this: 

<P>
<PRE>
prompt# mount -t pvfs2 tcp://testhost:3334/pvfs2-fs /mnt/pvfs2

<P>
Under linux-2.4, the mount command looks slightly different:
<PRE>
prompt# mount -t pvfs2 pvfs2 /mnt/pvfs2 -o tcp://testhost:3334/pvfs2-fs
</PRE>

<P>
This error could also mean a pvfs2-client process is not running,
either because it was not started before the mount command, or was
terminated at some point. If you can reliably (or even intermittently)
cause the pvfs2-client to exit abnormally, please send a report to the
developers.

<P>
This error can also occur if you attempt to mount a second PVFS file system
on a client, where the new file system has the same name or ID as one
that is already mounted.  If you are trying to mount more than one file system
on the same client and have problems, please see question

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">5</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN> PVFS server consumes 100% of the CPU
</H2>

<P>
On some systems, the pvfs2-server will start consuming 100% of the CPU
after you try to read or write a file to PVFS.  gdb indicates that the
server is spending a lot of time in the glibc routine
<TT>'.handle_kernel_aio'</TT>.  Please check to see if your
distribution has an updated glibc package.  RHEL3, for example, will
exhibit this behavior with glibc-2.3.2-95.6, but not with the updated
glibc-2.3.2-95.20 package.  We have also seen this behavior on ppc64
systems running glibc-2.3.3-18.ydl.4 .  If you encounter this problem
and your distribution does not have an updated glibc package, you can
configure pvfs2 with <TT>-disable-aio-threaded-callbacks</TT>, though
this will result in a performance hit.  An alternate workaround is to
set <TT>LD_ASSUME_KERNEL</TT> to 2.4.1 before running pvfs2-server.
pvfs2-server will then use an older (and not as optimized) thread
library that does not have this bug.

<P>
At this time we do not know which of the two suggested workarounds is
better from a performance standpoint.  The <TT>LD_ASSUME_KERNEL</TT>
method might make more sense:  when/if the system's glibc is
upgraded, you will only have to restart pvfs2-server with the
environment variable unset.  You would not have to rebuild pvfs2 to take
advantage of the fix.

Phil Carns noticed that on some kernels, write-heavy workloads can trigger a
kernel bug.   The symptoms are that the PVFS server will only be able to
deliver a few KB/s, and the CPU utilization will be close to 100%.  The cause
appears to be related to ext3's ``reservation'' code (designed to reduce
fragmentation).  The solution is to either mount the filesystem with the
'noreservation' option, or upgrade your kernel.

<P>
PVFS needs several libraries.  If those libraries aren't in the default
locations, you might need to add flags when running PVFS's configure script.
At configure time you can, for example, pass <TT>-with-db=/path/to/db
-with-gm=/path/to/gm</TT> to compile with Berkeley DB and Myiricom GM libraries.
The configure options let the compiler know where to find the libraries at
compile time.

Those compile-time options, however, aren't enough to find the libraries at
run-time.  There are two ways to teach the system where to find libraries:

<P>
Several sites have reported poor PVFS performance early in the day that
eventually goes away until the next day, when the cycle begins again.  Daily
cron jobs might be the culprit in these cases.  In particular, most Linux
distributions have a daily cron job (maybe called 'slocate', 'locate' or
'updatedb') that indexes the entire file system.  Networked file systems such
as NFS are often excluded from this indexing.  

<P>
The exact steps to remove PVFS from this indexing process vary among
distributions.  Generally speaking, there should be a cron script in
<TT>/etc/cron.daily</TT> called 'slocate' or 'updatedb'.  That script should
have a list of excluded file systems (like /var/run and /tmp) and flie types (
like 'proc' and 'nfs').  Either add 'pvfs2' to the list of file types or add
the pvfs2 mount point to the list of excluded file systems.   Be sure to do
this on all machines in your cluster.

There's one last thing to check.  Are you you are using a Redhat or Fedora
distribution, but running with a stock kernel.org 2.4 kernel?  If so, you need
to set the environment variable <TT>LD_ASSUME_KERNEL</TT> to 2.4.1 or
<TT>pvfs2-client-core</TT> will try to use the NPTL thread library.  NPTL
requires a 2.6 kernel (or a heavily backported 2.4 kernel, which Redhat
provides).  Redhat systems expect to have such a kernel, so running a stock
kernel.org 2.4 kernel can cause issues with any multi-threaded application.  In
this particular case, the <TT>pvfs2-client-core</TT> failure is hidden and can
be tricky to diagnose.

<P>
On some Redhat systems, for compatibility reasons, the pvfs2-server
program is actually a script that wraps the installed pvfs2-server
binary.  We do this ONLY if we detect that PVFS is being installed on
a system with an NPTL implementation that we're incompatible with.
Specifically, the script exports the LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.2.5
environment variable and value to avoid using the NPTL at run-time.
The script quite literally exports this variable and then runs the
installed pvfs2-server binary which is named
<TT>pvfs2-server.bin</TT>.  So to properly shutdown or kill the
pvfs2-server application once it's running, you need to issue a
<TT>killall pvfs2-server.bin</TT> command instead of the more common

Linux 2.4.x kernel module will not even compile!  We have
compatibility code that can mend the differences in place, but we have
to be able to detect that you're running such a system.  Our configure
script tries hard to determine which version you're running and
matches it against a known list.  If you suspect you need this fix and
our script does not properly detect it, please send mail to the
mailing list and include the contents of your /etc/redhat-release

<P>
In addition, some Redhat versions ship with an NPTL (threading
library) implementation that PVFS is not compatible with.  We cannot
explain why the errors we're seeing are occurring, as they appear to be
in glibc and the threading library itself.  In short, we disable the
use of the NPTL on these few Redhat systems.  It should be noted that
we are fully compatible with other distributions that ship NPTL
libraries (such as Gentoo and Debian/unstable).

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">5</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">11</SPAN> Where is the kernel source on a Fedora system?</A>
</H2>

<P>
Older systems used to split up the kernel into several packages
(<TT>kernel</TT>, <TT>kernel-headers</TT>, <TT>kernel-source</TT>).
Fedora kernels are not split up that way.  Everything you need to build a
kernel module is in /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build.  For example, Fedora
Core 3 ships with linux-2.6.9-1.667.  When configuring PVFS, you would
pass <TT>-with-kernel=/lib/modules/2.6.9-1.667/build</TT> to the
configure script.

<P>
In Fedora Core 4 things changed a little bit.  In order to build the pvfs2
kernel module, make sure you have both a <TT>kernel</TT> and
<TT>kernel-devel</TT> package installed.  If you have an SMP box, then you'll
need to install the -smp versions of both - i.e. <TT>kernel-smp</TT> and
<TT>kernel-smp-devel</TT>.   After both packages are installed,
/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build will once again contain a correctly configured

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">5</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">12</SPAN> What are extended attributes? How do I use them with PVFS?</A>
</H2>
Extended attributes are name:value pairs associated with objects (files and directories
in the case of PVFS). They are extensions to the
normal attributes which are associated with all objects in the system (i.e. the stat data).
A complete overview of the extended attributes concepts can be found in man pages section 5 for attr.
On supported 2.4 kernels and all 2.6 kernels, PVFS allows users to store extended attributes
on file-system objects through the VFS as well as through the system interface. Example
usage scenarios are shown below,
To set an extended attribute ("key1", "val1") on a PVFS file foo,
<PRE>
prompt# setfattr -n key1 -v val1 /path/to/mounted/pvfs2/foo
</PRE>
To retrieve an extended attribute for a given key ("key1") on a PVFS file foo,
<PRE>
prompt# getfattr -n key1 /path/to/mounted/pvfs2/foo
</PRE>
To retrieve all attributes of a given PVFS file foo,
<PRE>
prompt# getfattr -m "" /path/to/mounted/pvfs2/foo
</PRE>
Note that PVFS uses a few standard names for its internal use that prohibit users
from reusing the same names. A list of such keys are as follows at the time
of writing of this document ("dir_ent", "root_handle",
"datafile_handles", "metafile_dist", "symlink_target"). Further, Linux also uses
a set of reserved keys to hold extended attributes that begin with the prefix "system.",
thus making them unavailable for regular usage.

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">5</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">13</SPAN> What are Access Control Lists? How do I enable Access Control Lists on PVFS?</A>
</H2>
Recent versions of PVFS support POSIX Access Control Lists (ACL), which are used to define fine-grained 
discretionary access rights for files and directories. Every object can be thought of as having 
associated with it an ACL that governs the discretionary access to that object; this ACL
is referred to as an access ACL. In addition, a directory may have an associated ACL that 
governs the initial access ACL for objects created within that directory; this ACL 
is referred to as a default ACL. Each ACL consists of a set of ACL entries. An ACL entry 
specifies the access permissions on the associated object for an individual user or a group 
of users as a combination of read, write and search/execute permissions.

<P>
PVFS supports POSIX ACLs by storing them as extended attributes. However, support
for access control based permission checking does not exist on 2.4 Linux kernels and is hence disabled on them.
Most recent version of the Linux 2.6 kernels do allow for such permission checks, and PVFS enables
ACLs on such kernels.
However, in order to use and enforce access control lists on 2.6 kernels, one must mount
the PVFS file system by specifying the "acl" option in the mount command line. For example,
<PRE>
prompt# mount -t pvfs2 tcp://testhost:3334/pvfs2-fs /mnt/pvfs2 -o acl
</PRE>
Please refer to the man pages of "setfacl", "getfacl" or section 5 acl for detailed usage

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">5</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">16</SPAN> Can we run the Apache webserver to serve files off a PVFS volume?</A>
</H2>

<P>
Sure you can! However, we recommend that you turn off the EnableSendfile option in
httpd.conf before starting the web server. Alternatively, you could configure
PVFS with the option <TT>-enable-kernel-sendfile</TT>. Passing this option
to configure results in a pvfs2 kernel module that supports the sendfile
callback.
But we recommend that unless the files that are being served are large enough
this may not be a good idea in terms of performance. Apache 2.x+ uses the <TT>sendfile</TT>
system call that normally stages the file-data through the page-cache. On recent 2.6 kernels,
this can be averted by providing a <TT>sendfile</TT> callback routine at the file-system.
Consequently, this ensures that we don't end up with stale or inconsistent cached data on such
kernels. However, on older 2.4 kernels the <TT>sendfile</TT> system call streams the data through
the page-cache and thus there is a real possibility of the data being served stale.
Therefore users of the <TT>sendfile</TT> system call are warned to be wary of this detail.

<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">6</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN> I ran Bonnie and/or IOzone and the performance is terrible.
Why? Is there anything I can do?
</H2>

<P>
We designed PVFS to work well for scientific applications in a cluster
environment.  In such an environment, a file system must either spend
time ensuring all client-side caches are in sync, or not use a cache
at all (which is how PVFS currently operates).  The <TT>bonnie</TT>
and <TT>bonnie++</TT> benchmarks read and write very small blocks -
on the order of 1K.  These many small requests must travel from the
client to the server and back again.  Without client-side caching,
there is no sane way to speed this up.

<P>
To improve benchmark performance, specify a bigger block size.   PVFS
has several more aggressive optimizations that can be turned on, but
those optimizations require that applications accessing PVFS can cope
with out-of-sync caches.  

<P>
In the future, PVFS is looking to provide optional semantics for use
through the VFS that will allow some client-side caching to speed these
kinds of serial benchmarks up.  By offering a way to explicitly sync
data at any given time or by providing 'close-to-open' semantics, these
kinds of caching improvements become an option for some applications.

<P>
Bear in mind that benchmarks such as IOzone and Bonnie were meant to
stress local file systems.   They do not accurately reflect the types of
workloads for which we designed PVFS.  Furthermore, because of their
serial nature, PVFS will be unable to deliver its full performance.
Instead try running a parallel file system benchmark like IOR
(<TT><A NAME="tex2html10"

</H2>
See Question&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:badperf">6.2</A>.  If the program uses small block sizes to
access a PVFS file, performance will suffer.  

<P>
Setting both (or either of) the <TT>TroveSyncMeta</TT> and
<TT>TroveSyncData</TT> options to <TT>no</TT> in the config file can
improve performance in some situations.  If you set the
value to no and the server is terminated unexpectedly, you will likely
lose data (or access to it).  Also, PVFS has a transparent server
side attribute cache (enabled by default), which can speed up
applications which read a lot of attributes (<TT>ls</TT>, for
example).  Playing around with the <TT>AttrCache*</TT> config file
settings may yield some performance improvements.  If you're running a
serial application on a single node, you can also use the client side
attribute cache (disabled by default).  This timeout is adjustable as
a command line argument to pvfs2-client.

<A NAME="sec:nfs_vs_pvfs2"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">6</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN> NFS outperforms PVFS for application XXX. Why?
</H2>

<P>
In an environment where there is one client accessing a file on one
server, NFS will outperform PVFS in many benchmarks.  NFS has
completely different consistency semantics, which work very well when
just one process accesses a file.  There is some ongoing work that
will optionally offer similar consistency semantics for PVFS, at
which point we will be playing on a level field, so to speak.
However, if you insist on benchmarking PVFS and NFS in a
single-client test, there are some immediate adjustments you can make.

<P>
The easiest way to improve PVFS performance is to increase the block
size of each access.  Large block sizes help most file systems, but
for PVFS they make a much larger difference in performance than they
do for other file systems.

<P>
Also, if the <TT>TroveSyncMeta</TT> and <TT>TroveSyncData</TT> options
are set to <TT>no</TT> in your PVFS configuration file, the server
will sync data to disk only when a flush or close operation is called.
The <TT>TroveSyncMeta</TT> option is set to <TT>yes</TT> by default, 
to limit the amount of
data that could be lost if a server is terminated unexpectedly.  With
this option enabled, it is somewhat analogous to mounting your NFS
volume with the <TT>sync</TT> flag, forcing it to sync data after each
operation.

<P>
As a final note on the issue, if you plan on running application XXX,
or a similar workload, and the NFS consistency semantics are adequate
for what you're doing, then perhaps PVFS is not a wise choice of file
system for you.  PVFS is not designed for serial workloads,
particularly one with small accesses.

<P>
This section covers questions about managing PVFS file systems.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION000101000000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">9</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN> How can I back up my PVFS file system?</A>
</H2>

<P>
The default storage implementation for PVFS (called Trove DBPF for ``DB Plus
Files'') stores all file system data held by a single server in a single
subdirectory.  In that subdirectory is a directory tree containing UNIX files
with file data and metadata.
This entire directory tree can be backed up in any manner you like and
restored if problems occur.

<P>
As a side note, this was not possible in PVFS v1, and is one of the many
improvements present in the new system.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION000102000000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">9</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN> Can I add, remove, or change the order of the PVFS servers
            on an existing PVFS file system?</A>
</H2>

<P>
You can add and change the order of PVFS servers for an existing PVFS file
system.  At this time, you must stop all the servers in order to do so.

<P>
To add a new server:

<OL>
<LI>Unmount all clients
</LI>
<LI>Stop all servers
</LI>
<LI>Edit your config file to:
  
<OL>
<LI>Add a new Alias for the new server
</LI>
<LI>Add a new DataHandleRange for the new server (picking a range you
        didn't previously use)
  
</LI>
</OL>
</LI>
<LI>Deploy the new config file to all the servers, including the new one
</LI>
<LI>Create the storage space on the new server
</LI>
<LI>Start all servers
</LI>
<LI>Remount clients
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
To reorder the servers (causing round-robin to occur in a different relative
order):

<OL>
<LI>Unmount all clients
</LI>
<LI>Stop all servers
</LI>
<LI>Edit your config file to reorder the DataHandleRange entries
</LI>
<LI>Deploy the new config file to all the servers
</LI>
<LI>Start all servers
</LI>
<LI>Remount clients
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
Note that adding a new server will <SPAN  CLASS="textit">not</SPAN> cause existing datafiles to be
placed on the new server, although new ones will be (by default).  Migration
tools are necessary to move existing datafiles (see
Question&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:migration">9.3</A>) both in the case of a new server, or if you
wanted to migrate data off a server before removing it.

<P>

<A NAME="sec:migration"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">9</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN> Are there tools for migrating data between servers?
</H2>

<P>
Not at this time, no.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION000104000000000000000"></A>
<A NAME="sec:df-free-space"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">9</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN> Why does df show less free space than I think it should? What
            can I do about that?
</H2>

<P>
PVFS uses a particular algorithm for calculating the free space on a file
system that takes the minimum amount of space free on a single server and
multiplies this value by the number of servers storing file data.
This algorithm was chosen because it provides a lower-bound on the amount of
data that could be stored on the system at that point in time.

<P>
If this value seems low, it is likely that one of your servers has less space
than the others (either physical space, or because someone has put some other
data on the same local file system on which PVFS data is stored).  The
<TT>pvfs2-statfs</TT> utility, included with PVFS, can be used to check the
amount of free space on each server, as can the <TT>karma</TT> GUI.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION000105000000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">9</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">5</SPAN> Does PVFS have a maximum file system size? If so, what is it?</A>
</H2>

<P>
PVFS uses a 64-bit value for describing the offsets into files, so
theoretically file sizes are virtually unlimited.  However, in practice other
system constraints place upper bounds on the size of files and file systems.

<P>
To best calculate maximum file and file system sizes, you should determine the
maximum file and file system sizes for the local file system type that you are
using for PVFS server storage and multiply these values by the number of
servers you are using.

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">9</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">6</SPAN> Mouning PVFS with the interrupt option
</H2>
The PVFS kernel module supports the <TT>intr</TT> option provided by
network file systems.  This allows applications to be sent kill signals
when a filesystem is unresponsive (due to network failures, etc.).  The
option can be specified at mount time:
<PRE>
mount -t pvfs2 -o intr tcp://hosta:3334/pvfs2-fs /pvfs-storage/

<H1><A NAME="SECTION000110000000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">10</SPAN> Missing Features</A>
</H1>

<P>
This section discusses features that are not present in PVFS that are present
in some other file systems.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION000111000000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">10</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN> Why don't hardlinks work under PVFS?</A>
</H2>

<P>
We didn't implement hardlinks, and there is no plan to do so.  Symlinks are
implemented.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION000112000000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">10</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN> Can I <TT>mmap</TT> a PVFS file?</A>
</H2>

<P>
Private, read-only mmapping of files is supported.  Shared mmapping of files
is not.  Supporting this would force a great deal of additional infrastructure
into PVFS that would compromise the design goals of simplicity and
robustness.  This ``feature'' was intentionally left out, and it will remain
so.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION000113000000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">10</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN> Will PVFS store new files on servers with more space, allowing
            files to be stored when one server runs out of space?</A>
</H2>

<P>
No.  Currently PVFS does not intelligently place new files based on free
space.  It's a good idea, and possible, but we have not done this yet.  See
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec:contributing">11.1</A> for notes on how you could help get this
feature in place.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION000114000000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">10</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN> Does PVFS have locks?</A>
</H2>

<P>
No.  Locking subsystems add a great deal of shared state to a parallel file 
system implementation, and one of the primary design goals was to eliminate
shared state in PVFS.  This results in a simpler, more fault tolerant
overall system than would have been possible had we integrated locking into
the file system.

<P>
It's possible that an add-on locking subsystem will be developed at some point;
however, there is no plan to build such a system at this time.

<H1><A NAME="SECTION000120000000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">11</SPAN> Helping Out</A>
</H1>

<P>
This section covers ways one could contribute to the PVFS project.

<P>

<A NAME="sec:contributing"></A>
<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">11</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN> How can I contribute to the PVFS project?
</H2>

<P>
There are lots of ways to directly or indirectly contribute to the PVFS
project.  Reporting bugs helps us make the system better, and describing your
use of the PVFS system helps us better understand where and how PVFS is
being deployed.

<P>
Even better, patches that fix bugs, add features, or support new hardware are
very welcome!  The PVFS community has historically been a friendly one, and we
encourage users to discuss issues and exchange ideas on the mailing lists.

<P>
If you're interested in this type of exchange, we suggest joining the PVFS2
Developers List, grabbing the newest CVS version of the code, and seeing what
is new in PVFS.  See <TT><A NAME="tex2html14"
  HREF="http://www.pvfs.org/pvfs2/developers.html">http://www.pvfs.org/pvfs2/developers.html</A></TT> for more
details.

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">12</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN> BMI</A>

This section specifically covers questions about the BMI interface and
implementations.

<H3><A NAME="SECTION000131100000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">12</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN> What is the maximum packet size for BMI?</A>
</H3>

<P>
Each BMI module is allowed to define its own maximum message size.  See
<TT>BMI_tcp_get_info</TT>, <TT>BMI_gm_get_info</TT>, and
<TT>BMI_ib_get_info</TT> for examples of the maximum sizes that each of the
existing modules support.  The maximum should be reported when you issue a
<TT>get_info</TT> call with the option set to <TT>BMI_CHECK_MAXSIZE</TT>.
Higher level components of PVFS perform these checks in order to make sure
that they don't choose buffer sizes that are too large for the underlying
network.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION000131200000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">12</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN> What happens if I try to match a BMI send with a BMI receive
               that has too small a buffer?</A>
</H3>

<P>
If the receive buffer is too small for the incoming message, then the
communication will fail and an error will be reported if possible.  We
don't support any semantics for receiving partial messages or anything like
that.  Its ok if the receive buffer is too big, though.
